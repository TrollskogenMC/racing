[^1]Because commando, versioned-config and messenger are hosted on GitHub packages you will need to [setup GitHub Authentication for Maven](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages).
